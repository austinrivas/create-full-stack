Create Full Stack marries best practices in my 10 years developing at large tech companies like Google and small startups like MoPub as well as my own personal projects. At Google, I was impressed with the seamless integration of all the libraries and frameworks. The consistency across Google3 (Google's mono-repo) is incredible. Teams across the entire organization use the same tools with the same style guidelines and code can be shared and accessed anywhere. When starting a new project at Google you build on a stable foundation with significant guard rails in place. On the other hand, the tools are very Google specific and focus on performance over developer productivity (Google doesn't have issues hiring more SWEs which is incentivised in the Promo process since management is a component).

Leaving Google and returning to the outside world I'm dismayed that the same solid foundation doesn't exist. It's natural to cobble together solutions following one-off blog posts. A developers focus isn't and, shouldn't be, infra at an early stage so hacky solutions tend to win. Unfortunately, as what you're building scales, maintaining these solutions can be a nightmare.

Create Full Stack is my attempt to solve these problems and share my development philosophy. It's inspired by tools like CRA and Expo but applied to the backend, API layer, and dev ops.

It's a continuation of my thoughts and feedback around _[One full-stack to rule them all!](https://medium.com/@tiagsters/one-full-stack-to-rule-them-all-5ca39ded16c1)_
