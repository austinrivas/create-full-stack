If included, Create Full Stack scaffolds a TypeScript React Native app with [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/expo/expo.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://GitHub.com/expo/expo/stargazers/)

Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS and Android from the same codebase. It removes the dependency on XCode and Android Studio. It enables code pushes without going through the app store for updates.
