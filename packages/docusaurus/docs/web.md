If included, Create Full Stack scaffolds a TypeScript React app with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/facebook/create-react-app.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000)](https://GitHub.com/facebook/create-react-app/stargazers/)

CRA is the most popular React configuration. It is officially supported by Facebook, the creators of React. It uses client side rendering which is great for dynamic content (ex. user specific pages) unlike static site generators. Client-side rendering for React is currently more performant than server-side rendering. Facebook and Twitter are client-side rendered React apps.
