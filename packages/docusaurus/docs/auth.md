Auth choices for Create Full Stack.

## Auth0

This choice configures your backend and selected clients (web and/or mobile) with Auth0. This includes permissions/authorization on the API and a login page for the clients.

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) provides authentication and user management as a service. It has one-click integrations with every identity provider (Google, Facebook, Twitter etc.). From the Auth0 console you can manage your login page, emails, custom hooks and users. It easily integrates with either Apollo Server Express or Hasura [backends](/docs/backend). Auth0 provides great documentation and support and is free for up to 7k users.
