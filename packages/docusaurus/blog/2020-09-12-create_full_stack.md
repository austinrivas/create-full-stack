Create Full Stack marries best practices I picked up over a decade developing at large tech companies like Google and small startups like MoPub, as well as my own personal projects ([Compare Hospitals](https://comparehospitals.org/), [WhetherÂ°](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1446510851), [Flixfindr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekf3k5jIGT4)). At Google, I was impressed with the seamless integration of all the libraries and frameworks. The consistency across Google3 (Google's mono-repo) is incredible. Teams across the entire organization use the same tools with the same style guidelines, and code can be shared and accessed anywhere. When starting a new project, Google developers build on a stable foundation with significant guard rails in place. On the other hand, the tools are very company-specific and focus on performance over developer productivity.

Since leaving Google and returning to the outside world, I've been dismayed that the same solid foundation doesn't exist. It's natural to cobble together solutions following one-off blog posts. A developer's focus isn't - and shouldn't be - infra at an early stage so hacky solutions tend to win. Unfortunately, as what you're building scales, maintaining these solutions can be a nightmare.

Create Full Stack is my attempt to solve these problems and share my development philosophy. It's inspired by tools like CRA and Expo but applied to the backend, API layer, and dev ops.

It's a continuation of my thoughts and feedback around my featured Medium article _[One full-stack to rule them all!](/blog/rule_them_all)_
