## Resetting Docker Postgres locally

Sometimes you may need to completely wipe your local Postgres DB running on Docker. For instance, you're developing Create Full Stack and switching between Auth0 and no auth ðŸ˜ƒ.

Todo this remove the Docker container then the volume.

```bash
docker rm <project name>_postgres_1
docker volume rm <project name>_db_data
```
