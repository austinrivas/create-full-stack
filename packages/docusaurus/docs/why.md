## Problem

As a developer you want to focus on building your application. Delighting your users! You donâ€™t want to think about configurations and fitting libraries and frameworks together. You want something to get started today that you wonâ€™t have to rewrite tomorrow.

## Solution

Don't start from scratch, use CFS instead!

- Guard rails
  - Static type checking from DB to UX and back
    - API layer is type checked with GraphQL
  - Strict linting and code formatting without sacrificing velocity
    - Almost everything is autofix on save in VSCode
- Single language and tool chain
  - No context switching between different languages and build tools
- Pre-configured cloud setup
  - No need to mess around with AWS/Azure/GCP
    - Pulumi IAC ensures your full stack is cloud production ready with one deploy command
  - CI/CD
    - No ðŸ’© gets checked in
    - Pushes to master automatically update infra and deploy your full stack
- Best tools in class
  - Every [library and framework](/docs/libraries_and_frameworks) has a large community
  - Ensures fewer edge cases and better support
